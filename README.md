## FAQ

If you have any questions not on this list, feel free to email [hello@markbase.xyz](mailto:hello@markbase.xyz)

### What makes this better than all the other free Obsidian Publish alternatives out there?

Markbase is completely **non-technical** - you don't need to learn about GitHub, do any special configuration steps in Notepad or learn about hosting providers like Netlify. 

Literally all you have to do is create an account, install the plugin, choose a folder of Markdown files and that's it!

There are downsides - Markbase isn't open-source or as customizable as other GitHub-based alternatives. It's great if you're after an easy, low-hassle solution otherwise those other solutions are still out there!

### I want {this feature} - can you add it?

You can suggest and vote on features in the [public roadmap](https://trello.com/b/qYaGuz0i/markbase-product-roadmap)! I read all of them and prioritize them according to votes. Thanks for your feedback - it helps heaps to know what the community wants in the early days.

### {Something} doesn't work - what do I do?

Markbase is definitely still in early development so there's bound to be bugs that surface during your use.

If you find one, submit a ticket in the [help center](https://markbase.tawk.help/), use the live chat in the app dashboard or email [hello@markbase.xyz](mailto:hello@markbase.xyz).
